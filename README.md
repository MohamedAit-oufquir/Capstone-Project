React + Vite

   I built a full-stack e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with React to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express , providing RESTful APIs to handle client requests. I used MongoDB as the database, designing structured schemas for products, users, and orders to ensure data consistency. The frontend and backend communicate through custom APIs , enabling features like user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and order processing. This project demonstrates a complete understanding of modern web development, from frontend design to secure, scalable server-side logic.
